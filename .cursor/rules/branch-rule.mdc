# Git Workflow Rule – Mandatory Feature Branches

When implementing ANY new feature, refactor, or non-trivial change:

1. ALWAYS create a new Git branch before writing code.
2. Branch naming format:
   feature/<short-kebab-case-description>
   or
   fix/<short-kebab-case-description>

3. NEVER commit directly to main or develop.

4. After implementation:
   - Commit changes with a clear message
   - Push the branch
   - Open a Pull Request targeting `main`

5. In the PR description:
   - Summarize what was added
   - List key files changed
   - Mention any architectural decisions

If a task does not require code changes, no branch is needed.
